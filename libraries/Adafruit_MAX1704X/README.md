## About the MAX1704X ##

The MAX17048/MAX17049 ICs are tiny, micropower current
fuel gauges for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld
and portable equipment. The MAX17048 operates with
a single lithium cell and the MAX17049 with two lithium
cells in series.

More information on the MAX1704X can be found in the datasheet: https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/battery-management/MAX17048.html
