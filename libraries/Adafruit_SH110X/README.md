Preferred installation method is to use the Arduino IDE Library Manager. To download the source from Github instead, click "Clone or download" above, then "Download ZIP." After uncompressing, rename the resulting folder Adafruit_SH110X. Check that the Adafruit_SH110X folder contains Adafruit_SH110X.cpp and Adafruit_SH110X.h.

You will also have to install the **Adafruit GFX library** which provides graphics primitves such as lines, circles, text, etc. This also can be found in the Arduino Library Manager, or you can get the source from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
